🔐 Password Manager

Welcome to the Password Manager project—a safe haven for all your “I’ll just use the same password everywhere” habits. This Python-powered app lets you securely store, retrieve, and manage your passwords, so you can finally retire that sticky note under your keyboard.

🚀 Features
	•	Store Your Secrets: Save your passwords for all your accounts—no judgment here.
	•	Easy Retrieval: Forgot your Netflix password again? We’ve got you.
	•	Simple, Intuitive UI: Because managing passwords shouldn’t require a password.
	•	Local Storage: Your data stays with you. (We don’t want your passwords, promise.)

🛠️ Getting Started
	1.	Clone the repository:git clone https://github.com/git-emran/Password-Manager.git
cd Password-Manager

	2.	Run the app:python main.py

	3.	Start adding and retrieving passwords like a pro.

📦 Project Structure
	•	‎⁠main.py⁠ – The brains of the operation.
	•	‎⁠data.txt⁠ – Where your (encrypted!) secrets live.
	•	‎⁠logo.png⁠ – A little flair for your UI.
